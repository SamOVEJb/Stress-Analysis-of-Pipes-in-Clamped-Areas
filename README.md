# Stress-Analysis-of-Pipes-in-Clamped-Areas
This project focuses on the stress analysis of pipes subjected to external loads and internal pressure, specifically in clamped regions. It aims to evaluate stress distribution, deformation, and potential failure points under static and dynamic loading scenarios, ensuring the integrity of piping systems under operational conditions.
